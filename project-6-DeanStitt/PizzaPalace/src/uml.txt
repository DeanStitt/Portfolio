PreUML and PostUML are similar both have like methods and variables. The differences are within the code, 
added variables for calculations, group buttons ect. without coding the uml is difficult to configure.
The lack of reading through the whole document plagued the assignment, but the final draft meets the requirements of classes
for each panel and order calculation. Without working through the code and testing different cases the ability to write the 
entire program in one uml is unlikely. The separate classes implemented after show the difference in good OOP and 
"cowboy style coding" as Dr.Eddy says. The missed variables and button grouping show the lack of experience with planning.
The method calls and added code are required to implement the code within the private classes.
